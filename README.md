# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

## Project Overview
This project developed a dashboard that displayed the results found on the Belly Button Data Set publish by NC State â€“ The Public Science Lab. On the webpage developed you can see all the information arranged in different charts and selecting the Test Subject you can have visible details found on the research. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the remaining bacteria were relatively rare.
